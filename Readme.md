##About:
The group project assignment was done in teams of 3. We were assigned to create a slot machine in Unity, but we decided to add a twist on it, making the entire game have RPG elements to it, where the player must navigate through the dungeon and attack monsters/heal depending on the slot’s outcome. Raul and Tin-Tin were responsible for scripting the slot machine along with the animation and effects, and Kun-An was in charge of providing the art assets.

##Game Mechanics:
Instead of a traditional slot machine with mini games, the screen has 2 windows, one with the slot machine control panel, and another with the in-game scene with combat. The player must traverse through the dungeon and rely on luck to determine how far they could survive.
We made sure the dungeon walls would move after a battle has ended, where it was triggered by a simple offset of the texture to look as if the player is traversing into the dungeon deeper. We implemented inputs to respond to raycast depending on where the player clicks the screen, making for a potential port to mobile devices in the future possible. The entire games framework was done with state machines and events, for cleaner and flexible working environments.
